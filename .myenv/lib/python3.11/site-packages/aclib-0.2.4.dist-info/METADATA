aclib - The alphacruncher python library
========================================

Installation
============

.. code:: bash

    $ pip install aclib

Usage
=====
The library provides 2 convenience functions for connecting to the remote database with your credentials.
It assumes that you have a credential file ``~/.odbc.ini`` in the following format

::

    [nuvolos]
    uid = <username>
    pwd = <password>

The library will also look for a special ``/lifecycle/.dbpath`` file.
When used inside an Alphacruncher application, this file is populated by the platfrom
with the db and schema name of the application, and the library will pick these up automatically.

You can then get the SQLAlchemy connection string, or create an SQLAlchemy engine directly:

::

    >>> from aclib import get_url, get_engine
    >>> get_url()
    'snowflake://<username>:<password>@alphacruncher.eu-central-1/?warehouse=<username>'
    >>> get_url("db_name","schema_name")
    'snowflake://<username>:<password>@alphacruncher.eu-central-1/?warehouse=<username>&database=db_name&schema=schema_name'
    >>> eng = get_engine("db_name","schema_name")
